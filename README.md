# FPGA_VGA_Driver
The project is about designing a VGA Driver for VGA monitor using FPGA board. MODELSIM is used for simulation and creating .txt file for online vga screen. The project report is also uploaded which contains complete details of project along with wave simulation.
The lune and terre are the VHDL file of ROM memory created in QUARTUS II and sync 16 is the main VHDL file that contains the main code of VGA Driver. The simulation_data is a .txt file that is to be uploaded on to a online VGA monitor https://ericeastwood.com/lab/vga-simulator/ for display.
